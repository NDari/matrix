/*
Package matrix implements a "mat" object, which behaves like a 2D array
or list in other programming languages. Under the hood, the mat object is a
flat slice, which provides for optimal performance in Go, while the methods
and constructors provide for a higher level of performance and abstraction
when compared to the "2D" slices of go (slices of slices). Due to it's internal
representation, row or column vectors can also be easily created by the Matf32
object, without a performance hit, by setting the number of rows or columns to
one.

All errors encountered in this package, such as attempting to access an
element out of bounds are treated as critical error, and thus, the code
immediately exits with signal 1. In such cases, the function/method in
which the error was encountered is printed to the screen, in addition
to the full stack trace, in order to help fix the issue rapidly.

/*
Matf32FromData creates a mat object from a []float32 or a [][]float32 slice.
This function is designed to do the "right thing" based on the type of
the slice passed to it. The "right thing" based on each possible case
is as follows:

Assume that s is a [][]float32, and v is a []float32 for the examples
below.

	x := matrix.Matf32FromData(v)

In this case, x.Dims() is (1, len(v)), and the values in x are the same
as the values in v. x is essentially a row vector.

Alternatively, this function can be invoked as:

	x := matrix.Matf32FromData(v, a)

In this case, x.Dims() is (a, 1), and the values in x are the same
as the values in v. x is essentially a column vector. Note that a
must be equal to len(v).

Finally for the case where the data is a []float32, the function can be
invoked as:

	x := matrix.Matf32FromData(v, a, b)

In this case, x.Dims() is (a, b), and the values in x are the same as
the values in v. Note that a*b must be equal to len(v). Also note that
this is equivalent to:

    x := matrix.Matf32FromData(v).reshape(a,b)

This function can also be invoked with data that is stored in a 2D
slice ([][]float32). Just as the []float32 case, there are three
possibilities:

	x := matrix.Matf32FromData(s)

In this case, x.Dims() is (len(s), len(s[0])), and the values in x
are the same as the values in s. It is assumed that s is not jagged.

Another form to call this function with a 2D slice of data is:

	x := matrix.Matf32FromData(s, a)

In this case, x.Dims() is (a, a), and the values in x are the same
as the values in s. Note that the total number of elements in s
must be exactly a*a.

Finally, this function can be called as:

	x := matrix.Matf32FromData(s, a, b)

In this case, x.Dims() is (a, b), and the values in x are the same
as the values in s. Note that the total number of elements in s
must be exactly a*b. Also note that this is equivalent to:

	x := matrix.Matf32FromData(s).Reshape(a, b)

Choose the format that suits your needs, as there is no performance
difference between the two forms.
